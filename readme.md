# [broccoli](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli)-jade [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/broccoli-jade.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/broccoli-jade)

> Compile [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) templates

*Issues with the output should be reported on the Jade [issue tracker](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/issues).*


## Install

```
$ npm install --save-dev broccoli-jade
```


## Usage

```js
var jade = require('broccoli-jade');
tree = jade(tree, options);
```

### A note about include paths

Include paths are resolved relative to the root of the tree, not to the Jade file itself. There are however workarounds to this, for example by using [`broccoli-static-compiler`](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-static-compiler) - here's an [example](https://gist.github.com/fredrikekelund/7222b0fe9e7a2b600918).

## API

### jade(tree, [options])

#### options

See the Jade [options](http://jade-lang.com/api/).

In addition you can pass in `options.data` that will be used as locals for your HTML compilation.
